Problem Statement - Movie Recommendation System.

This project is based on collaborative filtering.

What is Collaborative Filtering?

Collaborative filtering is a technique that can filter out items that a user might like on the basis of reactions by similar users. It works by searching a large group of people and finding a smaller set of users with tastes similar to a particular user.

This is a machine learning movie recommendation system model using collaborative filtering.

Data Set - The data set is present in the repository and was taken from Kaggle.

The Recommendation system recommends the movies that have a high correlation with the movie that we want to compare with and as a large set of people are present in the dataset so I have taken 100 people for the comparison.

The Python library used is NumPy’s and panda’s to use the inbuilt functions present in them. For the Data to be analyzed Pythion’s matplotlib and seaborn library are used. For the cleaning of data, the panda data frame is been used. For this particular program, I have used two movies -
1 - “Toy Story”
2 - “Return of the Jedi”

Now our recommendation system gets all or print all the movies that have a similar correlation with these two movies.
